Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm a solo developer from Japan, and I built Fukuraku because
I spent 30+ hours on tax filing for my side job last year.

As a salaried employee with side income, the process was painful:
- Piles of paper receipts with no organization
- Manual Excel data entry for every single receipt
- Constant confusion about expense categories
- Uncertainty about whether my income crossed the filing threshold

Existing tools like freee and MoneyForward are great, but they're
designed for full-time freelancers and small businesses — way too
complex for someone who just needs to track side-job expenses.

So I built Fukuraku: take a photo of your receipt, and AI handles
the rest. That's it.

Tech stack:
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, RLS)
- Vercel AI SDK + OpenAI GPT-4o Vision
- Stripe for subscriptions
- Vercel for hosting
- PWA support for mobile

Monthly operating cost: ~$51

The app is in Japanese (targeting the Japanese market), but I'd
love feedback from anyone interested in the tech or the approach.

AMA! Happy to answer questions about the tech, the market,
or solo development in Japan. 🇯🇵
